                <img src="img/found.png" alt="Mr. Praveen">
                <p>Praveen Kumar L also affectionately called Rider Praveen, is an ex-gym instructor who gave up his
                    job, his means of livelihood, all his and his familyâ€™s assets and savings to start We Save Animals
                    (WSA) Welfare Trust. From paralysed, blind, old-age animals to accident cases, cruelty cases and
                    terminally ill animals - he takes them all in, giving them happiness, food and a home in his
                    shelter.s</p>

            <div>
                <h3 class=" center">How it started</h3>
                <p>It started for Praveen in 2013, when he rescued a kitten with a spinal injury. He nursed it at home,
                    but it passed away after a week, leaving Praveen to wonder what he could do to help numerous animals
                    like this, that suffer in silence. So he started by rescuing injured animals, and keeping them at
                    home. Soon, as the number of rescues increased, he started looking for temporary shelters to house
                    them. Eventually, the news of his rescue got around and he started attending to approximately 4-5
                    cases in a day were People Use to tag him in social media Like Facebook etc. He took the help of Dr.
                    Girish from Blue Cross and Dr. Lohith frm Maruthi pet clinic and started an account in their
                    respective clinics, so that injured animals could be attended to, without a delay due to the
                    finances. So as the number of rescues went up, so did the bill amount in the clinics. But that did
                    not deter Praveen. <br><br>

                    The word spread, and Praveen, who was initially contacted for rescues only around South Bangalore,
                    started getting calls for help for cases in Mysore, Mandya, Chikmagalur Hosur etc. To manage things
                    better, Praveen started a WhatsApp group With Just 6 People And started attending To this cases
                    full-time. He had no option but to give up his job, financial help was low, but with his family
                    standing behind him, praveen kept doing whatever he could for the animals.</p>
